### *Diffuse Core Feature: Really Bright Cornell Box!*

###### Thu Sep 19 10:44:49 EDT 2024

Currently working on the diffuse bsdf part. Out of the core features this is the "hardest" part. 

Using my code from CIS 461 to help me with this.

Figured out that the trace depth of the scene (the maximum number of bounces) is specified by the scene json! Cool.

#### Questions to TA: 
* In the iterative naive version of the path tracing code, we had these concepts: throughput and radiance. In our base code, the path segments only contain a color, which starts at vec3(1.). How do we adapt throughput and radiance to this?

Below first implementation of the diffuse bsdf shading code. Have no idea what's working and what's not because the output is so blown out.

Could I be not accounting for floating point error / averaging over total number of iterations?

Getting closer! I needed to change the seed of the RNG generator of each bounce. 

```c++
makeSeededRandomEngine(iter, idx, pathSegment.remainingBounces);
```

But the illumination still looks weird...
