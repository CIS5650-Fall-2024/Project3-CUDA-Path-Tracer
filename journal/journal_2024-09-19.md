### *Diffuse Core Feature: "The real diffuse were the friends we made along the way"*

#### To Do

* ~~Implement Diffuse BSDF~~
* Implement perfect specular BSDF
* Implement terminating paths using stream compaction
* Make path segments contiguous in memory by material type
* implement stochastic sampled antialiasing: https://paulbourke.net/miscellaneous/raytracing/

#### Summary

Implemented the diffuse shading part of the `shadeMaterial` kernel. Was quite a debugging journey today trying to figure that out!

Note to self: the code I wrote for my GLSL path tracer from last year wasn't completely correct as I found out... so I'll be checking my work against the `PBRv5` book from now on!

Currently working on the diffuse bsdf part. Out of the core features this is the "hardest" part. 

Using my code from CIS 461 to help me with this. 

###### Thu Sep 19 11:07:02 EDT 2024

Figured out that the trace depth of the scene (the maximum number of bounces) is specified by the scene json! Cool.

#### Questions to TA: 
* In the iterative naive version of the path tracing code, we had these concepts: throughput and radiance. In our base code, the path segments only contain a color, which starts at vec3(1.). How do we adapt throughput and radiance to this?

Below first implementation of the diffuse bsdf shading code. Have no idea what's working and what's not because the output is so blown out.

Could I be not accounting for floating point error / averaging over total number of iterations?

Getting closer! I needed to change the seed of the RNG generator of each bounce. 

```c++
makeSeededRandomEngine(iter, idx, pathSegment.remainingBounces);
```

But the illumination still looks weird...

We got there in the end!!!

First, I fixed a bug in my world-to-local coordinates code that was making the `wi` weird:

Okay... still not great. Found out I was using the `wo` vector to calculate my lambertian absdot function, so I fixed that:

Much better! But the corners of the box looked way to bright for some reason... and I couldn't really put my finger on it. I had some idea that it was probably the way I was calculating my `pdf`? 

So I was looking through the Physically Based Rendering book and pretty found out I was missing something: 

```c++
// From https://pbr-book.org/4ed/Reflection_Models/Diffuse_Reflection, 
// to be honest I'm not sure what this does yet.
// I guess, if we're intersecting with a point that's 
// "upside down", we have to flip our generated iw too?
if (local_wo.z < 0) wi.z *= -1;

// get the pdf (square to hemisphere cosine)
pdf = glm::abs(wi.z) * INV_PI;
```
So apparently, if you find that the z value of your `wo` is less than zero, you should flip your `wi` and calculate the `pdf` function. I'm not really sure why. I should probably give the book more of a read to find out! 

Anyway, that totally fixed my problem, hooray!:
