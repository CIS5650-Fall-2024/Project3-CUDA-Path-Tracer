### OBJ & glTF Loading
The glTF (GL Transmission Format) file is a streamlined, efficient format for transmitting 3D models and scenes, designed specifically for real-time rendering applications such as 3D games, web platforms, and virtual reality. Developed by the Khronos Group, the same organization behind OpenGL and Vulkan, it is lightweight and optimized for performance. A glTF file can encompass an entire scene, including meshes, materials, animations, cameras, and lights. However, I focus on utilizing only its meshes and materials in my projects.

### BVH(MTBVH) Acceleration
[BVH](https://www.pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/Primitives_and_Intersection_Acceleration/Bounding_Volume_Hierarchies)
[MTBVH](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~thachisu/tdf2015.pdf)

Computing intersections is the most time consuming part in our path tracer.
A BVH organizes a set of geometric objects, like triangles or meshes, into a hierarchy of nested bounding volumes, which allows for efficient spatial queries and reduces the computational cost of determining which objects are relevant in a given operation.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>with BVH</th>
        <th>without BVH</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th><img src="./img2024/BVH.png"/></th>
        <th><img src="./img2024/noBVH.png"/></th>
    </tr>
</table>

My computer struggles to traverse millions of triangles, but thanks to BVH, the speedup is significant.

### Stochastic Sampled Anti-Aliasing

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>with Anti-Aliasing</th>
        <th>without Anti-Aliasing</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th><img src="./img2024/AA1.png"/></th>
        <th><img src="./img2024/noAA1.png"/></th>
    </tr>
</table>

### Physically-Based Materials
I implemented Microfacet material and metallic workflow in my path tracer. 
Here, the ball with high metallic and high roughness looks weird, this is because in microfacet model high roughness will cause energy loss.

### Texture Mapping & Normal Mapping
To improve the visual quality of the scene, texture mapping is crucial. Normal mapping can further enhance surface detail, adding greater realism.

### Multiple Importance Sampling
