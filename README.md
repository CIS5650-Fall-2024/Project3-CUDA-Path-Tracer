## Introduction

This project is a CUDA Path Tracer developed on top of the base code provided by the University of Pennsylvania, CIS 565: GPU Programming and Architecture. Features implemented include: 
* Parallelized Naive Lighting Integrator
* Full Lighting Integrator with MIS
* Arbitrary .glTF mesh support with materials and textures (albedo and normals)
* BSDFs (Diffuse, Specular, Microfacet, etc.)
